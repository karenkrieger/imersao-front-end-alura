# Imersão Alura Front-End 2025 Projects

This repository contains two projects developed as part of my participation in the **Imersão Alura Front-End 2025**. During the immersion, I had the opportunity to deepen my front-end skills by building two distinct projects:

## Projects

### 1. Spotify Site Layout (HTML/CSS)
- **Description:** A static website layout inspired by Spotify, designed using pure HTML and CSS.
- **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Usage:** Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the layout.

### 2. Spotify Site with React
- **Description:** A dynamic version of the Spotify layout built with React. This project demonstrates component-based architecture and interactive UI elements.
- **Technologies:** React, JavaScript, CSS

## About the Immersion

**Imersão Alura Front-End 2025** was an intensive learning experience that helped me expand my knowledge in modern web development. It provided a hands-on approach to building real projects using current front-end technologies, and allowed me to explore both static and dynamic web design.
